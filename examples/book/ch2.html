    Lovelace's diagram from "note G", the first published computer algorithm
    In 1840, Babbage was invited to give a seminar at the University of Turin about his Analytical Engine. Luigi
    Menabrea, a
    young Italian engineer and the future Prime Minister of Italy, transcribed Babbage's lecture into French, and this
    transcript was subsequently published in the Bibliothèque universelle de Genève in October 1842. Babbage's friend
    Charles Wheatstone commissioned Ada Lovelace to translate Menabrea's paper into English. She then augmented the
    paper
    with notes, which were added to the translation. Ada Lovelace spent the better part of a year doing this, assisted
    with
    input from Babbage. These notes, which are more extensive than Menabrea's paper, were then published in the
    September
    1843 edition of Taylor's Scientific Memoirs under the initialism AAL.</p>

<p>Ada Lovelace's notes were labelled alphabetically from A to G. In note G, she describes an algorithm for the
    Analytical
    Engine to compute Bernoulli numbers. It is considered to be the first published algorithm ever specifically tailored
    for
    implementation on a computer, and Ada Lovelace has often been cited as the first computer programmer for this
    reason. The engine was never completed and so her program was never tested.</p>

<p>In 1953, more than a century after her death, Ada Lovelace's notes on Babbage's Analytical Engine were
    republished as an
    appendix to B. V. Bowden's Faster than Thought: A Symposium on Digital Computing Machines. The engine has now been
    recognised as an early model for a computer and her notes as a description of a computer and software.</p>
